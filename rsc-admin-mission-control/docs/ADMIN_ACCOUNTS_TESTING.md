## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Permission Validation Tests

1. **Login Test**
   ```bash
   # Test login for each account
   curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/auth/admin/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email":"orion.ops@rsc-chain.com","password":"admin123"}'
   ```

2. **GraphQL Permission Tests**
   ```graphql
   # Test with different accounts - should work for all except AUDITOR
   query {
     followBonusQueue {
       requests { id status }
     }
   }

   # Test approval - should work for SUPER_ADMIN, OPS_LEAD, ANALYST only
   mutation {
     approveFollowBonusRequest(requestId: "test-id", notes: "Test") {
       id status
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Bulk Operations Test**
   ```graphql
   # Should work for SUPER_ADMIN, OPS_LEAD only
   mutation {
     bulkFollowBonusAction(
       requestIds: ["id1", "id2"]
       action: "approve"
       notes: "Bulk test"
     ) {
       successful
       failed
     }
   }
   ```

### Frontend Permission Tests

1. **UI Element Visibility**
   - Login with each account and verify which buttons/actions are visible
   - AUDITOR should only see audit-related sections
   - VIEWER should see read-only interfaces

2. **Action Availability**
   - Try to approve requests with VIEWER account (should fail)
   - Try bulk operations with ANALYST account (should fail)
   - Verify error messages are appropriate

## 🔍 Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied Errors
- Check that the account has the required permissions
- Verify the JWT token contains correct role information
- Check GraphQL resolver guards are applied correctly

### Login Failures
- Ensure database is seeded: `pnpm run db:seed`
- Check password hashing is consistent
- Verify account is active in database

### UI Not Updating
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Check NextAuth session is updating correctly
- Verify GraphQL queries are using correct auth headers

## 🚀 Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test all accounts login
for account in "orion.ops@rsc-chain.com:admin123" "nova.ops@rsc-chain.com:nova2024" "centauri.ops@rsc-chain.com:centauri2024" "lyra.ops@rsc-chain.com:lyra2024" "phoenix.ops@rsc-chain.com:phoenix2024"; do
  IFS=':' read -r email password <<< "$account"
  echo "Testing $email..."
  curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/auth/admin/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"email\":\"$email\",\"password\":\"$password\"}" \
    -s | jq '.success'
done
```

## 📝 Development Notes

- Accounts are created during database seeding
- Passwords use bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- Permissions are enforced at both GraphQL resolver and component levels
- Audit logging captures all permission checks and failures
- Frontend conditionally renders UI elements based on permissions

**Remember**: Each account represents a different user persona. Test thoroughly to ensure security boundaries are properly enforced!
